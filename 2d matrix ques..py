2-D matrix (IPS7)
Create two 2-D list of nxn square matrix (Number of rows and columns are equal) m1 and m2. (i)Find the sum of two matrix m1 and m2.

(ii)Find the product of diagonal1(D1) and diagonal2(D2) in m3.

(iii)Find the sum of each row from 0 to n-1 and sum of each column from 0 to n-1. If the sum of each row matches with corresponding columns then print “Matrix magic” else print “-1”.
